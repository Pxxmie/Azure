# Azure

### What is Azure?

**Azure**, also known as Microsoft Azure, is a **cloud computing platform** and infrastructure provided by **Microsoft**.

Azure provides four levels of management: **management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources**. These levels of organisation in Azure provide a structured way to **manage resources, apply policies, and control access**, making it easier to effectively use and manage cloud services within an organisation.

The following diagram shows the relationship between these levels.

 **Management Groups**: 

Management groups are a way to manage access, policies, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. You use management groups to organise subscriptions based on departments etc. 


**Subscriptions:**

 It provides a way to group and manage resources and services. Each subscription can have its own billing, access control, and resource limits.

**Resource Groups:**

Are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

**Resources:**

Resources are individual services or components provided by Azure (e.g., virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, etc.).
