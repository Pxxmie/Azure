# Azure

## What is Azure?

**Azure**, also known as Microsoft Azure, is a **cloud computing platform** and infrastructure provided by **Microsoft**.

Azure provides four levels of management: **management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and resources**. These levels of organisation in Azure provide a structured way to **manage resources, apply policies, and control access**, making it easier to effectively use and manage cloud services within an organisation.

The following diagram shows the relationship between these levels.

 **Management Groups**: Management groups are a way to manage access, policies, and compliance for multiple subscriptions. You use management groups to organise subscriptions based on departments etc. 


**Subscriptions:** It provides a way to group and manage resources and services. Each subscription can have its own billing, access control, and resource limits.

**Resource Groups:** Are logical containers where you can deploy and manage Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts.

**Resources:** Resources are individual services or components provided by Azure (e.g., virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, etc.).

## Advantage of using Microsoft Azure 

- Scalability -  Azure allows companies to easily change how much computing power and storage they use. This helps them save money and make sure they always have enough resources for their needs.

- Security - Offers several security services like Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault, and Azure Information Protection. These tools work together to safeguard an organisation's data and applications.

- Flexibility - Offers a diverse range of services and choices. This means organisations can select the services and options that align best with their requirements, whether it's virtual machines, containers etc. 

- Cost Savings - Azure enables organisations to pay only for the resources they actually use. This can lead to cost savings and improved operational efficiency.
